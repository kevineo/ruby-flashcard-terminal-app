## Ruby terminal flashcards app

A basic ruby terminal app that loads flashcard decks from CSV files.

For now, run `ruby controller.rb` in the terminal to run the program.

### Adding more decks

To create more decks add CSV files to the root directory in the following format:

front of card description | back of card description
--- | ---
card 1 front | card 1 back
card 2 front | card 2 back
card 3 front | card 3 back
etc... | etc...

If you make a new deck, fork this project, add the deck and make a pull request!
